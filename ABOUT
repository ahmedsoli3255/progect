-my accomplish 
    my project is button to On/Off led and calculate the temperature Calculate the temperature every 3 minutes at the same time.

-Thinking
    1. Connect Components (Led, Buttons, Temperature Sensitive) With Arduino.
    2. Thinking In a Timing Way Instead Of Delay Because The Delay Works To Freeze The Microcontroller.
    3. Write The Code.

My Experience Is Good .
